# Build Research

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Development Environment
- Using devcontainers for consistent, isolated development across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Cross-platform compatibility ensured for both WSL and non-WSL Windows environments
- Secure isolation for testing and debugging through containerization

### Project Management
- Python UV for package and dependency management due to its performance and reliability
- Python 3.12+ as the primary runtime for modern language features
- Type hints throughout codebase for improved code quality and maintainability

### Code Quality & Standards
- Ruff and mypy for static type checking and code quality analysis
- Automated code quality improvements with safe fixes
- PEP8 compliance and Black formatting for consistent code style
- Comprehensive docstring documentation for all code components

### Security Considerations
- Gitleaks security workflows to prevent secret exposure
- GPG commit signing required across all environments
- Secure package management with SHA256 checksum verification
- No raw remote code execution - all external code validated before execution

## Build System Choices

### Package Management
- UV selected as primary Python package manager for:
  - Superior performance compared to pip/poetry
  - Built-in dependency resolution
  - Virtual environment management
  - Compatibility with pyproject.toml

### Development Tools
- pytest for testing framework
  - Supports idempotent test design
  - No for loops in tests for better maintainability
  - Comprehensive test coverage capabilities
- pre-commit hooks for:
  - Code formatting (Black)
  - Import sorting (Ruff)
  - Type checking (mypy)
  - Security scanning (Gitleaks)

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated branch updates from main
- Pre-commit automation for code quality
- Secure build and test isolation in containers

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Docker Desktop/Engine for container support
2. Python 3.12+ installation
3. UV package manager
4. Git with GPG signing configured

### DevContainer Configuration
- Full cross-platform compatibility
- Isolated development environment
- Pre-configured development tools:
  - Python 3.12
  - UV package manager
  - Development dependencies
  - Code quality tools (Ruff, mypy)
  - Testing framework (pytest)

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Open in VS Code with Remote Containers extension
3. DevContainer will automatically:
   - Build development environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure tools and extensions
   - Set up pre-commit hooks

### Security Features
- Isolated testing environment
- Secure package verification
- GPG commit signing
- .vscode excluded from git to prevent API key leakage
- Gitleaks pre-commit scanning
