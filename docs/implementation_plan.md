# Implementation Plan

## Project Intent and Goals

This project implements a Machine Control Protocol (MCP) server integrated with Google's Python Agent Developer Kit (ADK). The primary goals are:

1. Create a robust MCP server implementation using Python 3.12+ that exposes resources, tools, and prompts
2. Develop reusable and modular ADK agents that can seamlessly interact with MCP servers
3. Establish secure communication channels between frameworks while maintaining high performance
4. Enable extensible tool integration and resource handling capabilities

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. MCP Server Layer
   - Built with Python 3.12+ SDK (FastMCP)
   - Handles resource exposure and tool management
   - Manages secure authentication and authorization
   - Exposes standardized interfaces for agent interactions

2. ADK Integration Layer
   - Self-contained agent implementations
   - Tool integration management
   - Workflow orchestration
   - State management and streaming support

3. Resource Management Layer
   - Secure data access handlers
   - API integration components
   - Configuration management
   - Environment isolation via devcontainers

## Key Components and Interactions

1. Server Components (/src/my_server/)
   - server.py: Core MCP server implementation
   - Resource handlers for data access
   - Tool registration and management system
   - Authentication and authorization middleware

2. Agent Components (/agents/)
   - Modular agent directories with __init__.py and agent.py
   - Custom tool implementations
   - Workflow definitions
   - Integration interfaces

3. Development Environment
   - Cross-platform compatible devcontainers
   - Isolated testing environments
   - Development tooling and utilities
   - Security scanning and validation tools

4. Configuration Management
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Security credentials management
   - Resource access controls
   - Deployment configurations

## Development Standards and Practices

1. Code Quality and Style
   - Strict adherence to PEP8 and Python Black formatting
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Comprehensive docstring documentation
   - Ruff and mypy for code quality enforcement

2. Best Practices
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Implement reusable components and avoid code duplication
   - SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): Each module and class has a single, well-defined purpose
   - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Maintain clear, straightforward implementations
   - Secure coding practices with regular security scanning

3. Testing Standards
   - Idempotent test implementations
   - No for loops in tests
   - Isolated test environments using devcontainers
   - Comprehensive test coverage

4. Version Control
   - Signed commits with GPG signatures
   - Branch scoping limited to single features/fixes
   - Automated branch updates from main
   - Pre-commit hooks for code quality and security

5. Security Practices
   - Regular security scanning with gitleaks
   - No raw remote code execution
   - Package validation with SHA256 checksums
   - Secure credential management
   - STRIDE-based security analysis

6. Documentation
   - Maintained implementation plan and build research
   - Clear contribution guidelines
   - Development documentation
   - API documentation with expected behaviors
