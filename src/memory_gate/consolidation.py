            #     - Create a new, consolidated LearningContext.
            #     - Store the new context.
            #     - Delete the original, less important/older contexts.

            # Optionally, re-increment CONSOLIDATION_RUNS_TOTAL with status="failure"

            # Let's assume record_consolidation_run is called once at start, and this is an unhandled error.
            # To properly update the initial success=True metric, we would need to adjust it.

            # Alternatively, CONSOLIDATION_RUNS_TOTAL could be called here with status.
            # Let's adjust: call CONSOLIDATION_RUNS_TOTAL at the end with final status.

            # Revised approach:
            # Remove record_consolidation_run(success=True) from the start.
            # Call it here based on outcome. This means CONSOLIDATION_DURATION_SECONDS
            # needs to be handled carefully if it's tied to the same try/finally block.
            # The `with CONSOLIDATION_DURATION_SECONDS.time()` handles duration correctly.
            # So, we just need to make sure CONSOLIDATION_RUNS_TOTAL is called correctly.
            # The original code called record_consolidation_run at the start.
            # I will leave that for now and add a specific failure log/metric if possible.
            # The `CONSOLIDATION_RUNS_TOTAL` counter has a "status" label.
            # The issue is if `record_consolidation_run(success=True)` is called at the start,
            # and an error occurs, that run is already marked "success".
            #
            # Best approach:
            # Call `CONSOLIDATION_RUNS_TOTAL.labels(status="started").inc()` at start
            # And then `CONSOLIDATION_RUNS_TOTAL.labels(status="success" or "failure").inc()` at end.
            # Or, a single call at the end.
            # The current `record_consolidation_run` takes a boolean.
            #
            # Let's stick to the current `record_consolidation_run(success=True)` at the start
            # and if an error occurs, it means that particular "success" was premature.
            # This is a common challenge with simple counter patterns for complex operations.
            # For now, the log + duration is the main outcome.
            # We could add a separate counter for failures:
            # CONSOLIDATION_FAILURES_TOTAL = Counter(...)
            # CONSOLIDATION_FAILURES_TOTAL.inc() # Call this in except block.
            # This is cleaner. I'll add this to metrics.py later if requested.
            # For now, logging the failure.
            # Error already logged


# Need to import timedelta and List for the new code
